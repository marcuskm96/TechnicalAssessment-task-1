# Introduction 
The purpose of this project is to determine the candidate's technical proficiency. 

# The Assignment

This projects consists of a simple Yahtzee application which allows the user to roll their dice up to 3 times (and select which dice they wish to keep between rolls), then determine their score. 

The front-end portion of the application is complete, but the back-end is missing the neccessary logic to roll the dice and calculate the score. 

The candidate must implement the missing logic, and test that the application works as intended.

The rules for yahtzee are presented on the home page. The actual yahtzee game can be found here: /Home/Yahtzee.

# Getting started

To start the application in visual studio code, navigate to /TechnicalAssessment-task-1 and execute the "dotnet run" command.

To start the application using visual studio 2019, run the "TechnicalAssessment_task_1" project form within the IDE.

# Addtional information

There is no single correct way to solve this task. The most important thing is that you solve it in your own way, and be able to explain the decisions you made a long the way.
